# Projects
A collection of the projects I've worked on so far :) I hope to continue expanding it!

To run music_rnn.ipynb, I used Visual Studio Code. You'll likely have to download some of the libraries used, especially including pretty_midi and Pyfluidsynth. Please read "Music RNN Explained" 1 and 2, which explain what each chunk of code does.
